# NFT Mint DApp Boilerplate

### **This codebase is a WIP and contains tools + components to deploy your own NFT Drop DApp out of the box.**

**Tech Stack**
* Mantine **(UI)**
* NextJS **(Frontend)**
* Redux + Web3.js **(Middleware)**
* Solidity + Hardhat **(Middleware)**
* Google Cloud/Firebase Deployment **(Backend)**

Current progress includes custom ERC-721 contracts, Redux blockchain interaction setup, Hardhat tools, and Mantine UI theming. 

The end goal of this boilerplate is to have a suite of easy to use config files that populate the DApp for custom theming, contract deployment, and a CI/CD pipeline.
